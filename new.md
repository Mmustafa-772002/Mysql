# Introduction to SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful and standardized language designed for communicating with and managing databases. Initially called SEQUEL, SQL was developed in the 1970s by Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce at IBM, later renamed due to trademark issues. It is primarily used with relational database management systems (RDBMS) and employs simple English-like syntax for performing various operations on databases.

## SQL Features:

1. **Database Operations:** SQL is used to perform a wide range of operations on databases.
2. **Database Creation:** It facilitates the creation of databases.
3. **Well-Defined Standards:** SQL adheres to well-defined standards.
4. **Ease of Learning:** SQL is easy to learn and widely adopted.
5. **Multiple Views:** SQL enables the creation of multiple views of a database.
6. **Multiple Tables:** It supports the creation of multiple tables within a database.
7. **Multiple Indexes:** SQL allows the creation of multiple indexes in a database.
8. **Portability:** SQL queries are portable in nature.

## Understanding Data:

- **Data:** Refers to the collection of facts and figures gathered from various sources, representing meaningful information.

## Database Fundamentals:

- **Database:** A structured collection of data stored in a specific format, analogous to a library where books represent stored data.

1. Distributed Database
2. Object-Oriented Database
3. Centralized Database
4. Operational Database
5. Graph Database
6. NoSQL Database
7. Cloud Database
8. Relational Database
9. Hierarchical Database
10. Network Database

## Most Popular Databases:

1. Relational Database
2. NoSQL Database

## Popular Database Management Systems:

1. Oracle
2. MySQL
3. SQL Server
4. PostgreSQL
5. DB2
6. MongoDB
7. Cassandra
8. Redis
9. HBase
10. CouchDB

## Basic Database Queries:

1. **Create Database:**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE database_name;
   ```

2. **Drop Database:**

   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE database_name;
   ```

3. **Use Database:**

   ```sql
   USE database_name;
   ```

4. **Show Databases:**

   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

5. **Create Table:**

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE table_name (
       column1 datatype,
       column2 datatype,
       ...
   );
   ```

6. **Drop Table:**

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE table_name;
   ```

7. **Insert Into:**

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
   ```

8. **Select:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table_name;
   ```

9. **Update:**

   ```sql
   UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, ... WHERE condition;
   ```

10. **Delete:**
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
    ```

Advanced queries and database management commands like `ALTER TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, `MERGE`, `CREATE VIEW`, `DROP VIEW`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `DROP INDEX` are utilized for more sophisticated operations.

## Table, Row, and Column:

- **Table:** A collection of rows and columns in a tabular format.
- **Row:** A collection of data in a table, also known as a tuple.
- **Column:** A collection of data in a table, also known as an attribute.

## Table Constraints:

Constraints are rules applied to tables to maintain data integrity:

1. **Primary Key**
2. **Foreign Key**
3. **Unique Key**
4. **Not Null**
5. **Check**
6. **Default**
7. **Index**

## PRIMARY KEY:

- A unique identifier for each record in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values.

## FOREIGN KEY:

- A field in a table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a link between two tables.

## UNIQUE KEY:

- A set of one or more columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table, ensuring unique values in the column.

## NOT NULL:

- Ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values.

## CHECK:

- Ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.

## DEFAULT:

- Provides a default value for a column when no value is specified.

## INDEX:

- Used to speed up the retrieval of rows from a table, created using one or more columns of a table.

## SQL Commands:

1. **Data Definition Language (DDL):** CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE.
2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

6. **Miscellaneous Functions:** COALESCE, NULLIF, ISNULL, IIF, CASE.

## SQL Joins:

1. **Inner Join:** Returns records with matching values in both tables.
2. **Left Join:** Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
3. **Right Join:** Returns all records from the

right table and matched records from the left table. 4. **Full Join:** Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

## SQL Subqueries:

- A nested query within another query, usable with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.

## SQL Indexes:

- Speeds up the retrieval of rows from a table, created using `CREATE INDEX` statement.

## SQL Views:

- A virtual table based on the result set of a `SELECT` statement, simplifying complex queries and securing sensitive data.

## SQL Transactions:

- A sequence of operations performed as a single unit of work, committed or rolled back using `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` statements.

## SQL Security:

- Various features to protect databases from unauthorized access and data breaches, including user authentication, access control, and encryption.

## SQL Best Practices:

1. **Use Prepared Statements:** To prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. **Use Stored Procedures:** To improve performance and security.
3. **Use Indexes Wisely:** To speed up query execution.
4. **Normalize Data:** To reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
5. **Backup Data Regularly:** To prevent data loss in case of system failure.
6. **Use Transactions:** To maintain data consistency.

### **Stored Procedures:**

- Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code that can be stored and reused in a database. They enhance performance, reduce redundancy, and improve security.

  ```sql
  CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
  AS
  -- SQL code here
  ```

### **Triggers:**

- Triggers are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed or fired in response to specific events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
  AFTER INSERT ON table_name
  FOR EACH ROW
  -- Trigger logic here
  ```

### **Data Definition Language (DDL) Triggers:**

- DDL triggers respond to changes in the database structure, such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP statements.

  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER ddl_trigger_name
  AFTER CREATE ON DATABASE
  -- DDL Trigger logic here
  ```

### **Database Normalization:**

- Database normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables.

### **Denormalization:**

- Denormalization is the opposite of normalization, where redundant data is intentionally added to improve query performance by reducing the number of joins needed.

### **ACID Properties:**

- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties ensure the reliability of database transactions.

### **Data Warehousing:**

- Data warehousing involves collecting, storing, and managing data from different sources to support business intelligence and decision-making.

### **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):**

- OLAP is a category of software tools that allows users to analyze and interact with multidimensional data, often used for data mining and business intelligence.

### **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):**

- OLTP is a class of systems that support transaction-oriented applications, typically characterized by a large number of short online transactions.

### **Database Sharding:**

- Sharding is a database architecture strategy that involves dividing a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards.

### **Data Replication:**

- Data replication involves creating and maintaining copies of a database in different locations to improve availability and fault tolerance.

## Advanced Database Queries:

### **Advanced SELECT Statements:**

#### **DISTINCT Keyword:**

- The DISTINCT keyword is used to return unique values in a SELECT query.

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
  ```

#### **LIMIT and OFFSET:**

- LIMIT is used to restrict the number of rows returned, while OFFSET skips a specified number of rows before starting to return rows.

  ```sql
  SELECT column_name FROM table_name LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
  ```

#### **GROUP_CONCAT Function:**

- GROUP_CONCAT function concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string.

  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, GROUP_CONCAT(another_column) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;
  ```

#### **CASE Statement:**

- The CASE statement performs conditional logic within a SELECT statement.

  ```sql
  SELECT column_name,
         CASE
            WHEN condition1 THEN result1
            WHEN condition2 THEN result2
            ELSE default_result
         END
  FROM table_name;
  ```

### **Subqueries and Joins:**

#### **Correlated Subqueries:**

- A correlated subquery is a subquery that refers to the outer query, providing more flexibility.

  ```sql
  SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name = (SELECT MAX(another_column) FROM another_table WHERE correlated_condition);
  ```

#### **Self-Join:**

- A self-join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

  ```sql
  SELECT e1.employee_name, e2.manager_name
  FROM employee e1
  JOIN employee e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
  ```

## Additional SQL Statements:

### **RENAME Statement:**

- The RENAME statement is used to rename an existing table or column.

  ```sql
  RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;
  ```

### **DESCRIBE Statement:**

- The DESCRIBE statement provides information about the structure of a table.

  ```sql
  DESCRIBE table_name;
  ```

### **SHOW COLUMNS Statement:**

- The SHOW COLUMNS statement displays information about columns in a table.

  ```sql
  SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name;
  ```

### **EXPLAIN Statement:**

- The EXPLAIN statement provides information about how a SQL statement would be executed.

  ```sql
  EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table_name;
  ```

### **USER Statements:**

- User-related statements for user management:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY password;
  DROP USER user_name;
  GRANT privilege_name ON table_name TO user_name;
  REVOKE privilege_name ON table_name FROM user_name;
  ```

### **ROLE Statements:**

- Role-related statements for role management:

  ```sql
  CREATE ROLE role_name;
  DROP ROLE role_name;
  ```

### **SEQUENCE Statements:**

- Sequence-related statements for sequence management:

  ```sql
  CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;
  DROP SEQUENCE sequence_name;
  ```

### **SYNONYM Statements:**

- Synonym-related statements for synonym management:

  ```sql
  CREATE SYNONYM synonym_name FOR table_name;
  DROP SYNONYM synonym_name;
  ```
